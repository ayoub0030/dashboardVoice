# Emergency Call Management System

## üö® Project Overview

The Emergency Call Management System is an innovative solution developed during the hackathon to revolutionize how emergency services handle and respond to emergency calls. Our system provides a modern, efficient, and user-friendly interface for emergency operators to manage calls, dispatch appropriate services, and coordinate emergency responses in real-time.

### üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional emergency call systems often face challenges such as:
- Difficulty in managing multiple emergency calls simultaneously

### üí° Our Solution

We've developed a comprehensive web-based platform that:
- Provides an intuitive interface for handling emergency calls
- Supports multiple types of emergencies (Medical, Fire, Police)
- Offers real-time call transcription and status updates
- Includes smart dispatch functionality with location tracking
- Features a modern, responsive design for optimal usability
